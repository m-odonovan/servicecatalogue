# Service Catalogue
Working concept assembled using Canvas and Model Driven Microsoft Power Apps. Allow employees to browse a service catalogue and order items from it.

## Background
I wanted to create a basic service catalogue application that would allow you to use as a concept starter or spark some ideas on how you could take this further. Could be use for IT and other scenarios where internally a department offers services to the rest of the organisation, and you would like to manage the service catalogue through a useful tool as well as allow employees to browser and "order" items from the catalogue

## Its a sample
Please do note, this is a sample application that is not intended to be used in production environments as is. It is intended to help a Power Apps developer to learn how they could assemble such an application. It is certainly not a perfect solution, it hasn't been well tested, and is missing some key features that I hope you would add over time.

## How it works
There are 2 main applications which makeup this solution. 
1 - Admin Model Driven App
2 - User Canvas App

All data resides in the Microsoft Dataverse
The admin model driven app is where XYZ.
The canvas app is a 4 screen sample app designed for tablet form factor. Does ABC.
